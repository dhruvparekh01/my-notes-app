# My Notes

My Notes is a simple note taking web app where users can keep a private list of notes.

## Usage

1. Install all the dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start development server: `npm start` Starts a local server at http://localhost:3000
3. Build static files for deployment: `npm run build` <br>

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
